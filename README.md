# 🌤️ Moments Between Mondays  
### A Slice-of-Life Visual Novel About Growth, Connection, and Self-Discovery

**Moments Between Mondays** is a short, reflective **10–12 minute visual novel** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
Players step into the day of **Jean**, a 3rd-year Computer Science student navigating the complexities of academic pressure, self-doubt, and emotional connection.

## 💭 Game Concept

Jean is a CS student who faces a constant internal battle: she passes her exams, sometimes even scoring high, but never feels like she truly understands the material. Beneath her academic struggles lies a deeper challenge—**avoidant attachment**—which makes forming and maintaining friendships feel overwhelming and exhausting.

Through four pivotal scenes in a single day, players guide Jean through choices that reflect her internal conflicts:
- **Should she ask for help or struggle alone?**
- **Can she open up to others, or will she retreat into isolation?**
- **Will she be honest about her feelings, or hide behind a facade?**

Each decision shapes Jean's **relationship points**, **stress level**, and **honesty**, ultimately leading to one of three distinct endings that reflect her emotional journey.
